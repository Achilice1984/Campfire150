    	<h2>One BIG storytelling experiment</h2>
    	<p>As part of the Carlton Centre for Community Innovation at Carleton University, Campfire150 is also a research project.  We want to learn more about how stories can help online communities create knowledge together.  We also want to learn if we can take that online experience and translate it into citizens making positive change in their cities, towns and communities across the country.  By sharing your stories, taking part in celebrations or legacy projects and staying in touch with the Campfire150 you can help us figure out how to build meaningful, resilient communities on and offline.</p>
