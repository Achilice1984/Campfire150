        <h1>Mission/Vision</h1>
        <h2>Learning from Stories</h2>
        <p>Campfire150 wants to help Canadians learn more about each other and what we value about this place we call home.  By sharing our stories about Canadaâ€™s future Campfire 150 wants to create a modern, inclusive vision for this country.</p>
        <h2>One Big storytelling experiment</h2>
        <p>As part of the Carlton Centre for Community Innovation at Carleton University, Campfire150 is also a research project.  We want to learn more about how stories can help online communities create knowledge together.  We also want to learn if we can take that online experience and translate it into citizens making positive change in their cities, towns and communities across the country.  By sharing your stories, taking part in celebrations or legacy projects and staying in touch with the Campfire150 you can help us figure out how to build meaningful, resilient communities on and offline.</p>
        <h2>We promise to keep you in the loop</h2>
        <p>We promise to share what we are learning from your stories and the actions you take.  By agreeing to stay in touch with the project, we can send you updates on what we are learning about Canadians and the kind of Canada we all want to live in.  We can also let you know about great parties and projects you can be a part of in your community.</p>
