        <h1>Mission/Vision</h1>
        <h2>Learning from Stories</h2>
        <p>Campfire150 wants to help Canadians learn more about each other and what we value about this place we call home.  By sharing our stories about Canada’s future Campfire 150 wants to create a modern, inclusive vision for this country.</p>
        <h2>One Big storytelling experiment</h2>
        <p>As part of the Carlton Centre for Community Innovation at Carleton University, Campfire150 is also a research project.  We want to learn more about how stories can help online communities create knowledge together.  We also want to learn if we can take that online experience and translate it into citizens making positive change in their cities, towns and communities across the country.  By sharing your stories, taking part in celebrations or legacy projects and staying in touch with the Campfire150 you can help us figure out how to build meaningful, resilient communities on and offline.</p>
        <h2>We promise to keep you in the loop</h2>
        <p>We promise to share what we are learning from your stories and the actions you take.  By agreeing to stay in touch with the project, we can send you updates on what we are learning about Canadians and the kind of Canada we all want to live in.  We can also let you know about great parties and projects you can be a part of in your community.</p>

        <h2>Leanne Clare</h2>
        <p class="lead">Founder and Lead Storyteller</p>

        <p>The first story I remember telling was a lie. When I was about five years old some family friends moved into a house in our neighbourhood. My Dad and I biked past the house but we didn’t have time to stop in and visit. When I returned home I told my Mom we had been to the house. She asked what it was like inside and I gave her an elaborate description. When she later learned I had told an entertaining – but false – story, my reward was having my mouth washed out with soap. Luckily, the sharp taste of the soap didn’t wash away my interest in storytelling and I learned my lesson about the importance of reporting the truth.</p>
        <p>Since that time I have told countless stories as a radio journalist for the CBC and as a communications and public engagement specialist for the David Suzuki Foundation. I have collected deeply personal stories and reported on national events. I have come up with creative and compelling ways to engage citizens to take action on issues they may not even realize they care about. I have managed partnerships and projects with like-minded individuals in non-profits, governments, educational organizations and the business community to achieve common goals. I have broadened my perspective and added to my own repertoire of stories by living, working and playing in countries around the world.</p>
        <p>To ensure the success of this project I am currently enrolled in the Philanthropy and Nonprofit Leadership diploma at Carleton University. I am also a research associate at the Carleton Centre for Community Innovation, under which this project will be housed.</p>
        <p>As a globally minded citizen who also tries to make a difference in her own community, I want to help Canada grow up. As a natural-born storyteller, I think the best way to do that is to gather people around the modern campfire, known as the Internet, and start sharing their stories.</p>

        <p>As a child, I was obsessed with classical music. In the time away from the keyboard, I left a trail of books on opera, music history and libretto scattered throughout my home. When my Grade 2 teacher assigned the class to write an illustrated story I was absolutely inspired. The first family of classical music (The Mozarts) provided the perfect fodder for a short, illustrated fable. Sadly, my ability to spin a yarn was not paralleled by my skill as an artist. Despite my tale of a charming Spaniel and her desire to contribute to her master’s musical success, my teacher saw only one thing: imperfect handwriting and poorly drawn figures. She completely overlooked the story. At 8-years-old I realized three very important things about life: some pictures aren’t worth a thousand words, there’s more to life (and stories) than what meets the eye, and that someone needed to revolutionize word processing.</p>
        <p>Writing became the thread woven throughout my life, education and career. I honed my storytelling and analytical skills during undergraduate studies in Rhetoric & Professional Writing at the University of Waterloo and graduate studies in International Political Economy at the University of Warwick. Hard work, good fortune and dedication helped me to secure roles in strategy, research and writing at Digital 4Sight, Jupiter Research and The Conference Board of Canada. After a decade working in technology companies and early-stage start-ups, I launched A2W Consulting. Through this strategy-consulting practise I have guided clients to growth, performance and profit through pragmatic thinking and an analytical approach to product development. Involvement in The Campfire Project allows me to marry my professional experience with my profound passion for Canada, history and nature.</p>

        <p>I grew up drawing cartoons on the backs of my father’s discarded legal papers.  Stacks and stacks of documents, covered with sketches of cats, aliens and Superman.  Flash forward 20 years and I found myself entrenched in a familiar dichotomy; finishing my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto in Ethics, Society and Law, and packing my bags for animation school in Montreal.  Law might have been in my blood, but it wasn’t in my heart.  I had seen the magic of Pixar’s “Toy Story”, and marveled at how groups of artists, writers and programmers had worked together to produce a brilliant and compelling story.</p>
        <p>After nearly ten years working as an animator and production manager in Montreal’s booming video game industry, I moved to Ottawa to raise my young family and enjoy a change of pace.  During my maternity leave, I took on a number of volunteer projects for non-profits, where I encountered many frustrated organizations who were unable to update their html-based websites and needed guidance on social media strategy.  In response, I founded RedFish Graphics, an Ottawa-based web and graphic design company that specialises in helping non-profit organizations and start-ups.  Combining technical knowledge with graphic design, I could help others find their voice, and tell their stories.</p>
        <p>The Campfire project, with its innovative approach to online engagement, is a project that appeals to my desire to better understand how people and organizations communicate. I’m excited to help breathe life into, and be a part of, its story.</p>
